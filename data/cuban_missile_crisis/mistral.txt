Initially, the Soviet Union, under Nikita Khrushchev, sought to counter U.S. missile deployments in Turkey and Italy by placing nuclear missiles in Cuba. This move was also aimed at protecting Cuba from potential U.S. invasions and showcasing Soviet support for its ally. However, the U.S. discovery of these missiles led to a tense standoff. Despite the aggressive posturing, Khrushchev ultimately agreed to dismantle the missile sites in exchange for a U.S. pledge not to invade Cuba and a secret agreement to remove U.S. missiles from Turkey. This retreat, while averting nuclear war, was seen as a humiliation for the USSR and contributed to Khrushchev's eventual fall from power
